<p>This package defines APIs for cutting text into words.  
<hr>
	A Cutter is used to cut text of language specified by unicode scope. 
Because there are many types of language in the world, a single cutter 
couldn't analyze all grammar. Cutters are put in a CutterBox to deal with 
complex text. When a text is passed into CutterBox, it is transfered to a 
Cutters link. All Cutters in the link fetch the text belong to its unicode 
scope by LanguageFilter, and then cut it into words, passing the residual 
text to next Cutter. 
<p>
	It should be noticed that the text passed in is not sured to be dealt 
with. 
<p>
	CutterBox use NoiseFilter to filter noise word. All noise words must be 
defined in a file in the directory "DICT/NOISE/".For example, word "fool" 
needed to be filtered, it should be added to a file in "DICT/NOISE/", or 
added "fool" to a new file such as "myNoise.txt" in "DICT/NOISE/". Then the 
word "fool" will be ignored when cutting text. It's not needed to invoke any 
function for filtering text, CutterBox will do it when calling cutPage(Page). 
The construction of CutterBox is like below:

Noted that one word should be written in one row. If two words written in one 
row, for example, "fool fun", it will be regarded as one word.

Noted that the directory "DICT/NOISE/" is needed, even if no noise word is 
defined.
